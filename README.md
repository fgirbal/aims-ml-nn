# AIMS Machine Learning Assignment
#### Author: Francisco Girbal Eiras

The purpose of this assignment is to _"implement a neural network (NN) from scratch, without using the pre-implemented NN modules in popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and train it to perform regression or classification with a small dataset of their choice"_. 

The implementation is provided in the `small-nn` package which we install in the `experiments` Jupyter notebook for experiments on the MNIST dataset.

### Installation

To install `small-nn`, simply clone this repository and run:

```
cd aims-ml-nn
pip install .
```

At that point you should be able to reproduce the results in the `experiments.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
